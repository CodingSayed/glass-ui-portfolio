# Glass UI Portfolio

A modern, glass-inspired portfolio website focused on visual clarity, motion, and interaction.  
This project explores **Frutiger Aero–style glass UI**, depth, and subtle animation using clean, semantic frontend code.

The goal is not to showcase a framework-heavy application, but to demonstrate **UI craftsmanship**, layout decisions, and attention to detail.
